# Coding-Exercice
**This coding test consists of four exercises that utilize Vanilla JavaScript. The exercises cover topics such as Promises, Async/Await, and working with Arrays and Objects.**

***Question 1:*** In this exercise, the task was to create two boxes that display the width and height of the window. Right-clicking on the width box was to be disabled, while left-clicking on the height box was to be disabled. An alert message was to be displayed if a user attempted to click the disabled button. This exercise tested the ability to work with DOM elements and events.

***Question 2:*** The task in this exercise was to create a function that would change the color of a box after a specified delay. The function was to be called with a delay (in milliseconds) and a color (valid color string), and it was to return a Promise that resolved when the box color had been changed. This exercise tested the ability to work with Promises.

***Question 3:*** The task in this exercise was to modify the function created in Exercise 2 to use async/await instead of Promises. The same colors and delays were to be used as in Exercise 2. This exercise tested the ability to work with async/await.

***Question 4:*** In this exercise, the task was to find the highest and second-highest rated TV shows from an array of objects containing TV show data. If two or three shows had the same rating, the show with the higher number of ratings was to be chosen. The exercise tested the ability to work with arrays and objects and to use the reduce() method.

To test the code, simply open the HTML file in a web browser ( for question 4  check the console for output). Each exercise has its own JavaScript code and can be tested separately.
